  This guide provides an introduction to using the Agent and how it is used to
  send metrics for services and instances registered on the dbsnOOp platform.

# Docker Agent

## Overhead

General consumption varies according to the number of services coupled to it. On average, a service has an expected consumption of 0.05% of CPU on average and 150 Kb of RAM.

### Variables <a href="#deploy" id="deploy"></a>

| Variable           | Type     | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SNOOP\_API         | Required | dbsnOOp API URL, used as a communication channel for the platform and sending service metrics |
| SNOOP\_KEY         | Required | Unique key used to register the agent                                                         |
| SNOOP\_AGENT\_NAME | Optional | Customized name for identifying the agent within the platform                                 |



### Deployment

Within the dbsnOOp platform, we have a session dedicated to Deploys to speed up this process. In the deployments panel, we will access the Agent screen and select the model or system on which we will perform this installation.

Each model or system may require specific steps, but this entire process is described within its own installation page, and a one-line command is provided to make things easier.

Exemple Docker one-line install command:

```
docker run -d --name dbsnoop_agent --restart always -e "SNOOP_API=<DBSNOOP_API>" -e "SNOOP_KEY=<DBSNOOP_AGENT_KEY>" -e "SNOOP_AGENT_NAME=<AGENT_NAME>" dbsnoop/agent
```

dbsnOOp Agent has now been installed. You can check to see whether the Agent container has started by running `docker ps`:

```
root@server:~# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED           STATUS          PORTS    NAMES             
06f80b012969   dbsnoop/agent                  "docker-php-entrypoiâ€¦"   20 seconds ago    UP 20 seconds            dbsnoop_agent
```

To verify the agent status by running `dbsnoop stats` in container or by `docker exec -t`:

```
root@server:~# docker exec -t dbsnoop_agent dbsnoop stats
