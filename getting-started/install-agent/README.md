## When do I need to install an agent? <a href="#when-do-i-need-to-install-an-agent" id="when-do-i-need-to-install-an-agent"></a>

When a company's network infrastructure has limited access to our platform for services, it is necessary to install an Agent within this network infrastructure.

The agent will carry out periodic checks of registered environments, with more than 100 metrics applied to different services to bring the best solutions and suggestions.

## Difference Between Standard Agent and Local Agent <a href="#difference-between-standard-agent-and-local-agent" id="difference-between-standard-agent-and-local-agent"></a>

The big difference between the agents is the limitation of service registration, with the local agent being limited to only the installation of services linked to the host and once the agent has been installed, not being able to register more than one equal service. Unlike Standard, where you can register a much larger number of services.
